# Stock Price Prediction Web App

## Overview
The Stock Price Prediction Web App is an interactive platform designed to forecast future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The app fetches historical stock data, preprocesses it, trains a predictive model, and visualizes the results through intuitive charts. Users can input a stock ticker, select a historical period and interval, and receive predictions for the next day's stock price.

## Features
- **Stock Ticker Input**: Allows users to enter a stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA) to retrieve data.
- **Period and Interval Selection**: Users can select the historical data range and frequency for analysis.
- **Historical Data Visualization**: Displays historical stock prices using candlestick charts.
- **LSTM Model Predictions**: Predicts the next day's stock price based on historical data.
- **Training, Validation, and Test Data Visualization**: Shows performance of the model on different datasets.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for the interactive user interface.
- **Visualization**: Plotly for dynamic charts and data visualization.
- **Backend**: TensorFlow for LSTM model implementation and training.
- **Data Fetching**: yFinance for accessing historical stock data.
- **Data Processing**: Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing.
